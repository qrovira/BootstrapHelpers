HELPERS
  bs_include
      %= bs_include all => 1
      %= bs_include stylesheet => 1
      %= bs_include jquery => 1
      %= bs_include javascript => 1
      %= bs_include awesome => 1

    Include bootstrap or any of the required components using CDN links. Use
    *all* to load all at once.

    You can also provide *version*, *jquery_version* or *awesome_version*
    options to specify which bootstrap, jquery or font awesome versions to
    link to, respectively.

  bs_form_group
      %= bs_form_group 'email' => begin
      %= email_field 'email'
      % end

      %= bs_form_group 'email' => ( label => "e-Mail address" ) => begin
      %= text_field 'email'
      % end

    Generate the form-group wrapper for a given field. It will automatically
    check the specified param name on the validation for errors and add the
    "has-error" classes as needed.

    You can also provide a "label" attribute to autogenerate it.

      <div class="form-group">
        <input name="email"type="email" />
      </div>

      <div class="form-group">
        <label for="email" class="control-label">e-Mail address</label>
        <input name="email"type="email" />
      </div>

  bs_alert
      %= bs_alert success => "Operation completed"
      %= bs_alert danger => ( dismissable => 1 ) => begin
        <span>Something went terribly wrong</span>
      % end

    Generates a div wrapper with the alert and alert-$class classes.

      <div class="alert alert-success">Operation completed</siv>
      <div class="alert alert-danger">
        <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="alert" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button>
        <span>Something went terribly wrong</span>
      </div>

FLASH AND NOTIFICATION HELPERS
  bs_flash
      $self->bs_flash( warning => "Beware of the dog" );
      $self->bs_flash( danger => "The dog is attqacking you!" );
      $self->bs_flash( success => "The dog killed you!" );

    A stacking flash notification helper, similar to the regular flash. It
    can be called multiple times, to stack different messages.

  bs_notify
      $self->bs_notify( warning => "Beware of the dog" );
      $self->bs_notify( danger => "The dog is attqacking you!" );
      $self->bs_notify( success => "The dog killed you!" );

    Queues notifications for the user using the stash instead of the
    session.

  bs_flash_to
      $self->bs_flash( warning => "Beware of the dog", '/to/some/action' );

    Stacks a flash notification and calls redirect_to(...) with any
    additional arguments passed to this helper.

  bs_all_flashes
      <%= b_all_flashes %>

    This method will call the bs_alert helper with each notification found,
    both on the flashed notifications or the stash ones.
